## üõ†Ô∏è 1. Database Setup

**üóÉÔ∏è Create Database**: The project begins by creating a database named `hospital_management`.

```sql
    CREATE DATABASE hospital_management;
```

**üì¶ Create Table**: A table named `hospital_data` is created to store comprehensive hospital information.

```sql
    CREATE TABLE hospital_data (
        Hospital_Name VARCHAR(50),
        Location VARCHAR(50),
        Department VARCHAR(50),
        Doctors_Count INT,
        Patients_Count INT,
        Admission_Date DATE,
        Discharge_Date DATE,
        Medical_Expenses DECIMAL(10, 2)
    );
```

## üîç 2. Data Analysis & Business Questions

### üìä Patient Management Analysis

#### 1. **Total Number of Patients**
*Objective*: Write an SQL query to find the total number of patients across all hospitals.

```sql
    SELECT SUM(Patients_Count) AS Total_Patients
    FROM hospital_data;
```

#### 2. **Average Number of Doctors per Hospital**
*Objective*: Retrieve the average count of doctors available in each hospital.

```sql
      SELECT Hospital_Name, AVG(Doctors_Count) AS Avg_Doctors
  		FROM hospital_data
  		GROUP BY Hospital_Name;
```

#### 3. **Top 3 Departments with the Highest Number of Patients**
*Objective*: Find the top 3 hospital departments that have the highest number of patients.

```sql
      SELECT Department, SUM(Patients_Count) AS Total_Patients
  		FROM hospital_data
  		GROUP BY Department
  		ORDER BY Total_Patients DESC
  		LIMIT 3;
```

### üí∞ Financial Performance Analysis

#### 4. **Hospital with Maximum Medical Expenses**
*Objective*: Identify the hospital that recorded the highest medical expenses.
```sql
    SELECT * FROM hospital_data
    		ORDER BY Medical_Expenses DESC    
    			LIMIT 1;
```

#### 5. **Daily Average Medical Expenses**
*Objective*: Calculate the average medical expenses per day for each hospital.
```sql
    SELECT 
        Location AS Hospital_Name,
        AVG(Medical_Expenses / (Discharge_Date - Admission_Date + 1)) AS Average_Daily_Expenses
    FROM hospital_data
    WHERE Discharge_Date >= Admission_Date
    GROUP BY Location
    ORDER BY Average_Daily_Expenses DESC;
```

### üïê Operational Efficiency Analysis

#### 6. **Longest Hospital Stay**
*Objective*: Find the patient with the longest stay by calculating the difference between Discharge Date and Admission Date.
```sql
    SELECT  * ,
    		   (Discharge_Date - Admission_Date) AS Stay_Duration
    			FROM hospital_data
    			ORDER BY Stay_Duration DESC
    			LIMIT 1;
```

#### 7. **Total Patients Treated Per City**
*Objective*: Count the total number of patients treated in each city.
```sql
    SELECT Location AS City, SUM(Patients_Count) AS Total_Patients
    		FROM hospital_data
    		GROUP BY Location;
```

#### 8. **Average Length of Stay Per Department**
*Objective*: Calculate the average number of days patients spend in each department.
```sql
    SELECT Department, 
    	     	  ROUND(AVG(Discharge_Date - Admission_Date), 2) AS Avg_Stay_Days
    		FROM hospital_data
    		GROUP BY Department;
		
```

### üìà Performance Benchmarking

#### 9. **Identify the Department with the Lowest Number of Patients**
*Objective*: Find the department with the least number of patients.
```sql
  SELECT Department, SUM(Patients_Count) AS Total_Patients
  		FROM hospital_data
  		GROUP BY Department
  		ORDER BY Total_Patients ASC
  		LIMIT 1;

```

#### 10. **Monthly Medical Expenses Report**
*Objective*: Group the data by month and calculate the total medical expenses for each month.
```sql
  SELECT 
  	    TO_CHAR(Admission_Date, 'YYYY-MM') AS Month,
  	    SUM(Medical_Expenses) AS Total_Expenses
  		FROM hospital_data
  		GROUP BY Month
  		ORDER BY Month;	
```
